= What is Wallet Up? =
Wallet UP or Wal’UP is a Trademark of Wallet UP LLC.

As a software, Internet company, it aims to develop products to allow users (mainly churches, charities, small businesses) to have multiple financial services in one. Think of it as a Wallet, where Each Debit/Credit Card is lodged, and used depending on the need or importance.

Stemming from this, we have observed that users are more and more using the Peer-to-Peer payment, such as zelle, cashapp, paypal me, venmo, Messenger etc…

But why carrying many apps when you can have them all at once?
