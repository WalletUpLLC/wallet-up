= What is Wallet Up? =
Wallet UP or Wal’UP is a Trademark of Wallet UP LLC.

As a software, Internet company, it aims to develop products to allow users (mainly churches, charities, small businesses) to have multiple financial services in one. Think of it as a Wallet, where Each Debit/Credit Card is lodged, and used depending on the need or importance.

Stemming from this, we have observed that users are more and more using the Peer-to-Peer payment, such as zelle, cashapp, paypal me, venmo, Messenger etc…

But why carrying many apps when you can have them all at once?

In the search field type "Wallet Up" or "Walup" and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".
